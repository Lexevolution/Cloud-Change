# Cloud Change

This is a [Neos Mod Loader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to change what cloud endpoints Neos uses. Possibly useful for a custom cloud server.

The current default options also fix some of the issues [here](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3872).

## Config Options

TODO

## Building

Ensure that the required DLL's (listed in the `Directory.Build.props` file and in the individual `.csproj` files) can be found from standard installation paths (check `Directory.Build.props`).
Then use the `dotnet build` command to build.

Alternatively you can open the folder in Visual Studio and just use the GUI.

## Building<

Ensure that the required DLL's (listed in the `Directory.Build.props` file and in the individual `.csproj` files) can be found from standard installation paths (check `Directory.Build.props`).
Then use the `dotnet build` command to build.

Alternatively you can open the folder in Visual Studio and just use the GUI.
